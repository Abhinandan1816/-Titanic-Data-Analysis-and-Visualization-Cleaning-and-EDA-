# -Titanic-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Cleaning-and-EDA-

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
Contains details about passengers such as age, gender, class, and survival status.
Steps Performed
Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (e.g., filled Age with the median and Embarked with the mode).
Dropped irrelevant columns like Cabin.
Transformed categorical variables into numerical format for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed survival rates based on gender, class, and family size.
Visualized key trends using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Key Findings
Women had a higher survival rate than men.
Passengers in first class were more likely to survive.
Larger family sizes were associated with lower survival rates.
Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
